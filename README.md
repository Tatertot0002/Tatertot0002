## 🔭 Projects

I tend to pick up a lot of projects as time passes, mainly due to wanting to help others :sweat_smile:

However, here's a quick run down of some of the projects I'm working on / some of the teams I'm working in:

- 🤖 [`Outage Bot`] - a way to track your discord bots outages
- 🤖 [`Peacekeeper`] - a easy to use moderation bot with music commands

And many, many more things you can see by exploring [`my repositories`]!
